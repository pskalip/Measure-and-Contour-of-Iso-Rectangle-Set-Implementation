 ## How To Run
 
1) Navigate to the source file directory.
2) Note: The test case in consideration has to be in the same directory as the C++ source code files.
3) For measure of the test case, compile the measure file using the command: g++ DAA2_measure.cpp 
4) Execute the file and input the file names for input and output files respectively.
5) For contour of the test case, compile the contour file using the command: g++ DAA2_contour.cpp 
6) Execute the file and input the file names for input and output files respectively.
7) You should find the corresponding output text files in the same directory.
8) To visualize the contours and test cases, make the necessary changes in the Visualization Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

1) For an elaboration of the complexity, please look at the DAA_report_A1.pdf file.
2) For a more convenient web view, dowload the HTML file folder and open the final.html file in a browser of your choice.
